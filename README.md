On this project I'll create a rock paper scissors game that runs on the console of the browser

This is actually my second attempt at this project. The first time I managed to get it running and I was pretty proud of how it turned out.
But I didn't commit at all until the end and I also felt like I stumbled my way to the end and I didn't learn much from it.
So I'm trying it again to get a better understanding of the process.
